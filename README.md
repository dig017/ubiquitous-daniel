BurritoBot
The following project is an amateur and introductory project based on the art of burrito building.
The project is a simple chat bot that is ready to accept inputs.
The code is not complex and is very limited to the amount of inputs that it can take in.
The project contains very basic functions that pertain to components of building a burrito.
The type of inputs that the bot can accept mostly relate to burritos.
However, the bot can take in other inputs regarding other foods and output specific responses.
The bot can be exited at any point by inputting cancel/bye.
Once the user is done building their burritos they are prompted to input their credit card info.
Note: the burritobot will only successfully process true credit card numbers.
The project's use is for Python amateurs to understand the basic components of a chatbot.
